# KmerCounter

This Java project offers a solution to analyze the frequency of k-mers in both fasta and multifasta files. K-mers are subsequences of length k from a DNA sequence. Understanding their frequencies can provide valuable insights into genomic studies.

## Project Components

### File 1: ADN.java
This file hosts the core functionalities within the `ADN` class. Here's an overview of its key methods and functions:

- **Constructor**
  - Initializes essential variables such as the input file, output file, k values, and reads the input file.

- **`toString()`**
  - Generates a formatted string representing the k-mer frequency analysis, either for a single k or a range of k values.

- **`leeFichero()`**
  - Reads the input fasta file and stores the sequences in a local text file for efficient processing.

- **`kmers(int k)`**
  - Calculates the k-mer frequencies for a given k and returns the results in a formatted string.

- **`calculaGlobal(int k)`**
  - Computes global k-mer frequencies when multiple sequences are provided.

- **`kmers(int k, String sec)`**
  - Calculates the k-mer frequencies for a specific sequence and returns the results in a formatted string.

- **Helper functions**
  - `calculaMaximo(Integer[] numeros)`: Calculates the maximum value in an array.
  - `StringToIndex(String kmer)`: Converts a k-mer string to its numerical index representation.
  - `IndexToString(int pos, int k)`: Converts a numerical index to its corresponding k-mer string.

### File 2: Ejecutable.java
This file includes the `Ejecutable` class, which contains the main method for executing the program. The key functionalities include reading input parameters, invoking the `ADN` class, and saving the results to an output file.

## Detailed Workflow

1. **Input Parameters**
   - The program receives the following input parameters:
     - Filename: The name of the fasta or multifasta file.
     - k1: The starting value for k.
     - k2 (optional): The ending value for k if a range is specified.

2. **File Reading and Preprocessing**
   - The program reads the input fasta/multifasta file and preprocesses the sequences, storing them in a local text file for efficient access and analysis.

3. **K-mer Frequency Calculation**
   - For each specified k value (single or range), the program calculates the k-mer frequencies and formats the results.

4. **Output Generation**
   - The program generates a formatted output string representing the k-mer frequency analysis.

5. **Result Presentation**
   - The results are displayed in the console and saved to an output text file.

## Example Usage
To analyze a fasta file named `TYLCV.fna` with k = 3, execute the following command:

```bash
java -jar kmercounter.jar TYLCV.fna 3
```

The program will calculate the k-mer frequencies for k = 3 and display the results in the console, saving them to an output file.
